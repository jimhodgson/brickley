        The Brickley is a comedy writing contest with live judging and scoring. Players are given joke writing prompts, then have 24 hours to compose the best jokes they can write inspired by those prompts. Here's how it works.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>Presentation</h5>
        <p>
        The Host will present the jokes to the Judges as slides, live, without any identifying information other than the joke itself. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>Judging</h5>
        <p>
        Judges score the jokes, with the help of the audience, based on things like cleverness, rhetoric, incisiveness, etc.. Whomever has the most points at the end of judging wins. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>Scoring</h5>
        <p>
        We will do our best to screen jokes for stuff like content, AI use, and plagiarism. We recognize that parallel development is a thing, but we reserve unmitigated discretion.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>Screening</h5>
        <p>
        If two submitted jokes are deemed to be similar, the first joke submitted will be selected. The other party will not be scored that round. 
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
        <div class="row">
      <div class="one-full column">
        <h5>Winning</h5>
        <p>Scores and players names will be shown at the end of each round, but jokes will be scrambled so that judges can't guess whose jokes are whose. 
        </p>
